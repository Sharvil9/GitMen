# Recommended Development Cycle for GitMen

## Development Methodology

The recommended development cycle for GitMen combines **Agile** and **Feature-Driven Development (FDD)** methodologies. This approach provides flexibility for iterative development, while ensuring focus on modular and scalable features.

## Why Agile + Feature-Driven Development?

### Agile Advantages:
- **Iterative Development**: Enables rapid prototyping, testing, and feedback.
- **Flexibility**: Easily adapts to changing requirements.
- **Collaboration**: Encourages team communication and continuous delivery.

### Feature-Driven Development Advantages:
- **Focus on Features**: Prioritizes features like "gitMen stage" or "AI integration" as independent modules.
- **Scalability**: Allows each feature to be designed, implemented, and tested independently.
- **Modularity**: Simplifies debugging and future updates.

## Recommended Workflow

### 1. Planning
- **Feature Identification**: 
  - Break down requirements into granular features (e.g., "Drag-and-Drop Support").
  - Create detailed feature specifications for each module.
- **Sprint Planning**:
  - Organize features into weekly Agile sprints.
  - Prioritize based on user needs and technical dependencies.

### 2. Design
- **Documentation-Driven Development**:
  - Prepare specifications, architecture, and UI/UX designs before coding.
- **Modular Design**:
  - Ensure each feature is self-contained and interacts seamlessly with others.

### 3. Implementation
- **Feature Development**:
  - Build features incrementally as independent modules (e.g., TUI staging).
  - Use the Factory Pattern and Observer Pattern for extensibility.
- **Testing**:
  - Write unit tests for core logic.
  - Perform integration tests to ensure module compatibility.

### 4. Feedback and Iteration
- **Stakeholder Reviews**:
  - Regular demos for stakeholders to gather feedback.
- **Continuous Improvement**:
  - Update features based on user feedback and bug reports.

### 5. Deployment
- **Beta Releases**:
  - Deploy MVP features as beta releases for user testing.
- **Updates**:
  - Push regular updates based on feedback, ensuring backward compatibility.

## Tools and Resources

### Planning:
- **GitHub Projects**: For sprint management and backlog organization.
- **Trello/Asana**: Alternative tools for task tracking.

### Development:
- **Go**: Language of choice for GitMen.
- **Cobra**: CLI framework for command routing.
- **Bubble Tea**: TUI framework for interactive terminal components.

### Testing:
- **Go Testing Suite**: For unit and integration tests.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automated CI/CD pipelines.

## Development Cycle Timeline

### Phase 1: MVP Development
1. Core Git commands (`gitMen stage`, `gitMen resolve`, `gitMen log`).
2. TUI integration for staging and conflict resolution.
3. Drag-and-Drop file import.

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. AI integration (`ai/ai.go`).
2. Error search with Google (`core/error_search.go`).
3. Theme customization and marketplace.

### Phase 3: Documentation and Testing
1. Comprehensive documentation for all modules.
2. Unit and integration tests.
3. Bug tracking and resolution.

## Future Updates
The development cycle allows for seamless addition of:
- Advanced AI models.
- Community-driven plugins and themes.
- Collaborative features like live terminal pairing.
